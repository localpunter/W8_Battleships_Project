# Battleships Project - CodeClan JavaScript Group Project

The aim of  this project was to design a JavaScript project creating a SPA (single-page-application) and using the Pub/Sub pattern. It doesn't use any frameworks or libraries appart from webpack to build the bundle.

**Play the game:** http://battleships.arsgaming.com

**Group members:** Cristian Kaluzsik, Allan Hunter, Simon Shepard, Alvaro Alonso.

## Brief

Our group was given a brief with the following points to discuss and achieve in one week:

* Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

* Write your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.

* You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.

## Achievements

* We applied an agile aproach to our planning.

* Our MVP involved really basic functionalities: One-tile ships and a basic two-player mode (one placing the ships the other destroying them). This goal was fulfilled in about two days.

* The extensions improved the game offering a real two-player experience with 2 boards, several tile ships, the option to play again games and adding some audio effects that made the game more appealing.
